This Sparks package provides a variety of spark particle effects for use in your projects.

3 different variations are included - slow, medium and fast. Simply drag your chosen variation from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window. Sound effects are also provided; drag the corresponding audio prefab (slow, medium or fast) from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy also.

You may wish to tweak the spark effects to your taste. To do this, simply select your chosen effect in the Hierarchy window, and then alter any of its variables in the Inspector window (on the right). A good place to start would be the Rate (under Emission), Start Size and Start Speed.

Have fun!
